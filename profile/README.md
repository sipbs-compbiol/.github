# `sipbs-compbiol`

**Hi there!** ðŸ‘‹

This is the GitHub home of the `sipbs-compbiol` SIPBS Computational Biology group. We conduct research and teaching in bioinformatics and computational biology at the University of Strathclyde. Our main research interests are in microbial genomics, but extend to humans and plants, including

- Taxonomy and classification of microbes
- Relationships between genome evolution and phenotype, such as the ability to produce - or resist - antibiotics
- Modelling of biological processes and evolution
- Software and database development

If you'd like to know more, please visit our [group pages](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/)
